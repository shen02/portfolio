description: Project Summary

*   This project creates a solution generator for a [Lights-Out game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) of any square size by Boolean satisfiability using the Java Z3 SAT Solver Library.
*   You can read more about the project [here](https://github.com/shen02/CS2800Project).

Challenges

*   Solution generators for Lights-Out already exist; yet those solutions are found using linear algebraic methods. 

Results

*   The project uses Boolean algebra and logical computations (SAT Solver) to solve the puzzles, instead. 

Design Steps

*   Decided upon creating a solver for Lights-Out puzzles.
*   Conducted research on related subjects, such as the rules of the puzzle and the pre-existing solver methods.
*   Approached the goal with satisfiability solvers, and conducted research accordingly.
*   Reformulated the game into Boolean CNF statements.
*   Connected the CNF statements with the Z3 SAT Solver.
*   Created the interactive user interfaces for the project.

Skills Developed

*   Translation of puzzle games into Boolean algebraic statements.
*   Familiarity with the Z3 SAT Solver.
*   Programming in Java.
