description: <div>Project Summary</div>
<ul>
<li>This project creates a solution generator for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)"> Lights-Out game </a> of any square size by Boolean satisfiability using the Java Z3 SAT Solver Library.</li>
<li>You can read more about the project <a href="https://github.com/shen02/CS2800Project">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div>
		Challenges</div>
	<ul>
	<li>Solution generators for Lights-Out already exist; yet those solutions are found using linear algebraic methods.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
	Results</div>
<ul>
<li>The project uses Boolean algebra and logical computations (SAT Solver) to solve the puzzles, instead.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
	Design Steps</div>
<ul>
<li>Decided upon creating a solver for Lights-Out puzzles.</li>
<li>Conducted research on related subjects, such as the rules of the puzzle and the pre-existing solver methods.</li>
<li>Approached the goal with satisfiability solvers, and conducted research accordingly.</li>
<li>Reformulated the game into Boolean CNF statements.</li>
<li>Connected the CNF statements with the Z3 SAT Solver.</li>
<li>Created the interactive user interfaces for the project.</li>
</ul>
<div>
	Skills Developed</div>
<ul>
<li>Translation of puzzle games into Boolean algebraic statements.</li>
<li>Familiarity with the Z3 SAT Solver.</li>
<li>Programming in Java.</li>
</ul>
