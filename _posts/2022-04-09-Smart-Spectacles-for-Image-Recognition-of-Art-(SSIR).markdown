description: <div>Project Summary</div><ul><li>Builds and programs a pair of machine-learning and rapsberry-pi-based smart glasses that detects artworks and returns the result as audio feedbacks to the user.</li><li>Wearable technology with a unique purpose.</li><li>You can read more about the project <a href="https://github.com/shen02/eece4792">here</a>.</li></ul><div>Challenges</div><ul><li>Originally uses optics and refractions to project results onto the glasses lens; member with expertise in optics exited the team.</li><li>Object detection models requires 64-bit systems to run; raspberry pi board runs on 32-bit processor.</li></ul><div>Results</div><ul><li>Followed the alternative plan to return the feedback to the users using audio responses with a speaker.</li><li>Researched 32-bit system builds of the required programs.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Design Steps</div><ul><li>Decided upon building wearable technologies.</li><li>Designed prototype of the final product; computed Gantt charts and flow diagrams of the functionality of the prototype.</li><li>Organized material list and puchased materials accordingly.</li><li>Assembled the board and necesary external components (camera, speaker, buttons.)</li><li>Traveled to a local art museum and collected image data of specific paintings, expanding the machine learning dataset.</li><li>Trained the machine learning model using YOLOv5.</li><li>Combined the trained model with the raspberry pi board.</li></ul><div>Skills Developed</div><ul><li>Familiarity with the YOLO machine learning family.</li><li>Ability to coordinate with team through long periods of off-time.</li><li>Skills with raspberry pi boards.</li><li>Programming in Python.</li></ul>
